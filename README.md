`v0.1-pre-alpha` `MIT-0`

This is the Bibleio app monorepo. It contains code for the web app, planned mobile app, and planned desktop app.

Each project uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation) and [Bibleio Design](https://github.com/bibleio/design) for the frontend, and mobile/desktop apps use [Tauri v2](https://v2.tauri.app/start/).

This monorepo uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-corepack) and [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs).

Our designs are open source too! Check them out on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/wGbVSRMTDL4fx16vj3FMRB/Bibleio-App%2FWeb?node-id=290-311&m=dev&t=xjPhyMA5eDsA0LKJ-1), the file includes designs for our planned, unfinished features too. Learn more about our design system at [bibleio/design](https://github.com/bibleio/design).
