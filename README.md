This is the Bibleio app monorepo. It contains code for the [web app](#web-app), [mobile app](#mobile-app), and [desktop app](#desktop-app).

Each project uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation) and [Bibleio Design](https://github.com/bibleio/design) for the frontend, and mobile/desktop apps use [Tauri v2](https://v2.tauri.app/start/).

This monorepo uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-corepack) and [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs).

Our designs are open source too! Check them out on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1408514554388853422/bibleio-apps-websites), the file includes designs for our planned, unfinished features too.
